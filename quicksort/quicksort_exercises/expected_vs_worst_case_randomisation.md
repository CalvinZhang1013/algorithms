# Why do we analyse the expected running time of a randomised algorithm and not its worst-case running time?

Solution: We may be interested in the worst-case performance, but in that case, the randomisation is irrelevant: it wont improve the worst case. What randomisation can do is make the chance of encoutering a worst-case scenario small.
